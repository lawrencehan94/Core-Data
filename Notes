 ______.app.xcdatamodel
 
 Entities are like classes
 Attributes are like properties
 
 Core Data is for persistent storage (we can access data later)
 
 Managed object model -> Pulls data model into the core data stack
 - You will be interacting with the managed object context for most
 - Persistent store coordinator coordinates data and handles persistent store
 
 (1) Instantiate core data model
 (2) model instantiates store coordinator
 (3) then managed object context pulls data
 
 Create an entity
 (1) Rename entity "Priority"
 (2) Create an attribute "text" : String
 (3) Create an attribute "type" : String
 (4) Create an attribute "votesMax": Integer 32 (easier to access in code)
 (5) Create an attribute "votes": Integer 32
 
 OR THROUGH CODE
 let priority = Priority()
 priority.votes = Int32(exactly: 35)
